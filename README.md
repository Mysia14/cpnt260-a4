### Code Review

I had trouble aligning the images properly in the form/fieldset box. I read documentation from W3Schools and the MDN in an attempt to overcome the problem. 
I was also unable to get the image to display on the github pages site, I am unsure of why this is.
I also face some issues with github repository and command line. I could figure it out but it took around 2 hours to fix it.
Another bug that I run into this time was to position the logo in the right place and the nav link as well. An issue that I couldnt fix it in assignment 1 (page with the logo issue : https://mysia14.github.io/cnpt-260-a1/), but in this assignment for the logo and anv link are in the expected position.
